# EduConnect-OOP-Learning-Management-System

Welcome to the **EduConnect-OOP-Learning-Management-System Project** repository.
A fully object-oriented Educational Management System (EMS) built in Java for EduConnect. 
This project simulates a real-world development cycle, progressing through multiple phases to implement student, teacher, course, class, grade, and reporting modules.

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

The system architecture for this project follows a multi-layered object-oriented structure, designed for modularity, maintainability, and scalability:

1. **Domain Layer (Core Entities)**
Contains all essential business objects such as Student, Teacher, Course, Classroom, Enrollment, and Grade.
These classes define attributes, relationships, and core domain behavior.

2. **Service Layer (Business Logic Layer):** Includes all business operations such as registering students, assigning teachers, enrolling students, generating grades, and creating academic reports.
This layer enforces OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

3. **Presentation Layer (User Interaction):** Implements the interactive console-based menu system, allowing users to navigate through modules such as:
Student Management
Teacher Management
Course and Class Handling
Grade Management
Reporting Tools

Each layer communicates cleanly with the next, offering a clear separation of concerns and organized workflow throughout the system.
